XClone's key features
======================
* XClone has two modules of information: the read depth ratio (RDR) module and the B-allele frequency (BAF) module, where each of the modules has its own CNV states and noise models for likelihood function. 

* XClone introduces two orthogonal methods for smoothing the probabilities of assigning CNV states for each feature in each cell.

* XClone introduces a post-step for combining the CNV states computed from the RDR and BAF modules.
